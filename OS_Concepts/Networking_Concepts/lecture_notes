Layer 1 Devices:
OSI Model - 7 Layers
discuss bottom 3 layers - 1,2,3

Layer 1
	Analog modem
		modem = modulator + demodulator
		TO create connection between networks
		Single connection - concerned about the wire
		wire : on physical layerr - layer 1 of OSI
	
	HUB
		Concentrator/Repeater
		have few/many ports
		Uncommon now a days


Layer 2
	Switch
		ASIC - Application Specific integrated  Circuit
		Communicate only with local network devices
	
	Wireless access points (WAP)
		Connects wireless network segments with wired ones
		Comm, with local network devices.
	
Layer 3
	Multilayer switch
		Normal layer -> Network switching services
		uses ASIC for switching (this ASIC can route : so non local as well)
		highly programmable.
		Not very common -> expensive
	
	Router
		most common
		OSI Model layer 3 logical network info
		uses software programming
		Local and non local device comm.
	
Security Network Devices
------------------------
	Firewall
		PLaced on routers or hosts(software based)
		Multiple layers of OSI models can have firewalls
		Blocking packets
		Two methods
			Stateless inspection
				examine every packet against every set of rule and enforces
			stateful inspection
				only examine state of a connection between networks
				(mainly between internal and external connection)
				:General rule: External networks are not allowed to be initiated by
				internal networks.
		First line of defense : Police wall
	
	IDS (intrusion detection system)
		detecting attack or breach
		use log files or txt or emails to get to network admin
		Standards
			Signature based
				evaluate network traffic for known malware or attack signatures
			Anomaly based
				evaluate for suspicious changes
			policy based
				specific declared suspicious policy
		IDS deployed in a host level is called an HIDS (Host based Intrusion Detection System)
		
	IPS (Intrusion Prevention system)
		stop a breach or attack
		perform set of actions and inform network admin
		all traffic flow through IPS
		Standards are same as IDS
		Best placement : Between router and destination segment
		Active responses
			Block offending IP Address
			Close down vulnerable interfaces
			terminate network sessions
			Redirect attacks
			...more
			
	VPN Concentrator
		Provide proper tunneling and encryption depending on VPN connections
		Layer 2, layer3 and layer7
		Internet transactions (SSL VPN at layer7)
			Most concentrators work at layer3 of OSI, giving IPSec encryption via secure tunnel

Optimisation and Performance devices
-------------------------------------
	Load balancer
		AKA content switch or contenct filter
		load balance between multiple hosts that contain the same data
		Requests are dist to server farms to ensure no server gets overloaded.
	
	Proxy Servers
		Requests resources on the behalf of client machines
		retrieve networks from untrusted outside networks for the requesting clients.
		Hidden identity and protection of the clients
		filtering the content that is available to the client
		COmmonly requested webpages are cached for improved network performance
	
Basics of the Virtual Private Network
-------------------------------------
	VPN 
		helps remote hosts to connect to private network through a private tunnel 
		using a public network
		The private network sees the remote host is considered a local host
		even though the connection passes through many routers and systems, it is seen 
		by each as a direct connection
		Helps is reducing costs for organisations, since we dont need a leased line to create
		the connection.
	
	VPN Types
		Site to site VPNs
			Here a remote site's network is connected to a main site's network
			and seen as a local network segment
			the VPN concentrators on both sides will manage the connections
		Host to site VPNs (Remote Access VPNs)
			Remote users use to connect to local networks
			VPN concentrators on the local network controls the connection
			Remote hosts use VPN Client softwares.
		Host to Host VPNs
			Between two computers without a VPN client software
			VPN concentrator on the local network control the connection
			The host1 connect using the webbrowser which supports encryption tech like SSL/TLS
			to connect to VPN Concentrator.
	
	Protocols used by the VPNs
			Internet Protocol Security(IPSec)
